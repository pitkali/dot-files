Description: Another System Definition Facility
 asdf provides a "make" type functions for Common Lisp software.
 It drives compilation and dynamic loading for complex Lisp systems
 with multiple modules and files, and is the de facto standard used
 by free software written in Common Lisp.
 .
 Most Common Lisp implementations already provide asdf via (require "asdf"),
 but not all of them provide an up-to-date version.
