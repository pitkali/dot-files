    "Coerce NAME into a PATHNAME using standard Unix syntax.

Unix syntax is used whether or not the underlying system is Unix;
on such non-Unix systems it is only usable but for relative pathnames;
but especially to manipulate relative pathnames portably, it is of crucial
to possess a portable pathname syntax independent of the underlying OS.
This is what PARSE-UNIX-NAMESTRING provides, and why we use it in ASDF.

When given a PATHNAME object, just return it untouched.
When given NIL, just return NIL.
When given a non-null SYMBOL, first downcase its name and treat it as a string.
When given a STRING, portably decompose it into a pathname as below.

#\\/ separates directory components.

The last #\\/-separated substring is interpreted as follows:
1- If TYPE is :DIRECTORY or ENSURE-DIRECTORY is true,
 the string is made the last directory component, and NAME and TYPE are NIL.
 if the string is empty, it's the empty pathname with all slots NIL.
2- If TYPE is NIL, the substring is file-namestring, and its NAME and TYPE
 are separated by SPLIT-NAME-TYPE.
3- If TYPE is a string, it is the given TYPE, and the whole string is the NAME.

Directory components with an empty name the name . are removed.
Any directory named .. is read as DOT-DOT,
which must be one of :BACK or :UP and defaults to :BACK.

HOST, DEVICE and VERSION components are taken from DEFAULTS,
which itself defaults to *NIL-PATHNAME*, also used if DEFAULTS in NIL.
No host or device can be specified in the string itself,
which makes it unsuitable for absolute pathnames outside Unix.

For relative pathnames, these components (and hence the defaults) won't matter
if you use MERGE-PATHNAMES* but will matter if you use MERGE-PATHNAMES,
which is an important reason to always use MERGE-PATHNAMES*.

Arbitrary keys are accepted, and the parse result is passed to ENSURE-PATHNAME
with those keys, removing TYPE DEFAULTS and DOT-DOT.
When you're manipulating pathnames that are supposed to make sense portably
even though the OS may not be Unixish, we recommend you use :WANT-RELATIVE T
