# All my dot files

This repository aims to collect and track all the components required
for my local configuration of shell, editors, and the like. Anything
that is configurable using a text file should be added to track
configuration, enabling version controlled sync between different
computers and easy setup of new machines.

It is not really intended for general use, so there's not much
customisation available. I still chose to make it publicly available for
The Greater Good. Feel free to take inspiration for your own
configuration.

# Licensing

To enable legal reuse of anything larger than a snippet of code from
this repository I need to state licensing terms. Hence, all the original
code is explicitly licensed under MIT license (see LICENSE).

However, for simplicity, parts of the repository are actually third
party software with separate copyright and licensing. In all such cases,
original copyright and licensing information is preserved.
